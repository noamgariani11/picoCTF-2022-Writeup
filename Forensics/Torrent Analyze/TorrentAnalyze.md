# Description

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. <br>
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download <br>
some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the <br>
file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, <br>
like picoCTF{filename}. Captured traffic.

# Solution

```wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/165/torrent.pcap```

```wireshark torrent.pcap```

THe objective is to find the file(s) that were downloaded through bit torrent. This is likely going to be done with the hash. With bittorrent it's called the info_hash. I initially tried search by bittorrent.info_hash as a filter, but then realized it is with BT-DHT.

Then I used bt-dht and it gave me all of the bittorrent traffic.

I then looked at the first packet and expanded all the subtrees for the Bit Torrent protocol. I then scrolled through the packets until I saw info_hash.

This hash is not the correct one, so I decided to look for the info_hash that was seen the most. I did this by making info hash into a colomn.

After that I clicked the colomn (string) to sort through it based on the info_hash and looked for the one that appeared the most.

This is the info_hash that appeared the most.

I first put it into VirusTotal and found no matches so I then put it into google.

This directed me to find that it is an .iso file through Linuxtracker (first google result).

Flag: ```picoCTF{.....amd64.iso}```
