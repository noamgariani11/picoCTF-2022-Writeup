Go to this website and see what you can discover.

# Solution

After entering the webpage I clicked f12 to use inspect element and see the code of the website. This is alluded to from the "inpector" tag on the challenge.

Once inside I went to sources to more easily view the index (html), script.js (JavaScript), and style.css (Cascading Style Sheets).

Nothing of interest was found in index, but in the script.js and style.css was the second and first part of the flag.

When put together this is the flag.

Flag: ```picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_6ede...}```
