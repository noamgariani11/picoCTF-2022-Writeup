# Description

The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?

The website is here

# Solution

Since this is a fairly big site to search manually and it was alluded that the flag is somewhere is the source code by the description/title I downloaded the entire website with wget.

```wget -r -np -k http://saturn.picoctf.net:53295/```

-r is so that is recursivly get all the files.

-np is so that it does not ascend to the parent directory.

-k is to specify the link.

After running this command a folder should be made with all of the source from the site. I then simply ran grep recursively with pico to try to find the flag in the entire source code.

```grep -R pico```

For a more targeted search you can grep for picoCTF which will only get the line with the flag.

```grep -R pico```

If you want to go even further than that you can pipe that command into cut and do it based on a space as the delimiter and look at the third feild.

```grep -R pico | cut -d " " -f3```

This command gives you just the flag itself.

Flag: ```picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de9...}```
