# Description

Connect to this PostgreSQL server and find the flag!

```psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 51070 -U postgres pico```

Password is postgres

# Solution

It is known that this is postgres SQL so the commands used will reflect that.

First, it is needed to connect.

```psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 51070 -U postgres pico``` with password postgres.

Then I found the syntax to all relations/tables which is ```\dt``` command. It is shown that there is a table named flags.

I found two simple ways to output the table flag:
* ```TABLE flags;```
* ```SELECT * FROM "flags";```

This gave the flag in the table.

I then did, ```\copy flags to flag csv;```, which exported the flags table to my working directory. I then used quit to exit psql.

To get just the flag I ran this command:

```cat flag | grep -oE picoCTF{.*} --color=none```

You could also do it this way:

```cat flag | grep pico | cut -d "," -f4```

Flag: ```picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_31fd...}```
