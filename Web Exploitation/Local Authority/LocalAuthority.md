# Solution

In the page source you can see the login post request is using "login.php" file.

However in the sources tab it is not listed.

So I just went to ```http://saturn.picoctf.net:64710/login.php``` and now files appeared in the source.

In the login.php you can see some filtering and a hash but neither of these things help with logging in. But if you look at another file in the sources tab and shown at the top of the login.php code:

You can see a file called "secure.js".

This file justs shows that user and password in plaintext. So I now went back to the orginal path of the website with the given credentials. This directed me to ```http://saturn.picoctf.net:64710/admin.php``` where the flag was located.

Flag: ```picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_b0c...}```
